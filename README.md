# 🌊 OscIDyn 
### Simulation and Identification of Nonlinear Oscillator Dynamics

**A Python toolkit for simulating and identifying the dynamics of nonlinear oscillators using experimentally realistic setups, supporting both time- and frequency-domain analyses.**

---

## 🔧 Features
- Time-domain simulation (free vibration and harmonically forced)
- Frequency-domain simulation (experimentally realistic frequency sweeps)
- Frequency-domain identification (deep learning model)
