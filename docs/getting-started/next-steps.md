Now that you have installed **Poscidyn**, understand its core concepts, and reviewed the limitations, here’s a suggested path to get productive quickly.

## Basic usage
Keep the mental model from [Understanding Poscidyn](understanding-poscidyn.md) in mind: pick an oscillator model, choose an excitation model, and decide whether you want a time response or a frequency sweep.

Walk through the **Basic usage** pages in order:

  1. [Oscillator models](../usage/basic-usage/oscillator-models.md)
  2. [Excitation models](../usage/basic-usage/excitation-models.md)
  3. [Time response](../usage/basic-usage/time-response.md)
  4. [Frequency sweep](../usage/basic-usage/frequency-sweep.md)
  

!!! recommended

    Check out the [Examples](../examples/overview.md) page, it will not only make the usage of Poscidyn more clear, but also demonstrates some of the use cases of using Poscidyn (such as generating large datasets).

## Avanced usage
Once you have got the hang of the basic usage, move on to **Advanced usage** to explore Poscidyn's advanced (but still simple and powerfull) features:

  - [Choosing a solver](../usage/advanced-usage/choosing-a-solver.md)
  - [Configuring multistart strategies](../usage/advanced-usage/configuring-multistart-strategies.md)
  - [Configuring sweep methods](../usage/advanced-usage/configuring-sweep-methods.md)

## Extending Poscidyn
If built-in components are not enough, see [Extending Poscidyn](../usage/extending-poscidyn.md) to add custom models or excitation types.
