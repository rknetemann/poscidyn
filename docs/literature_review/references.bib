  abstract     = {The quest for realizing and manipulating ever smaller man-made movable structures and dynamical machines has spurred tremendous endeavors, led to important discoveries, and inspired researchers to venture to previously unexplored grounds. Scientific feats and technological milestones of miniaturization of mechanical structures have been widely accomplished by advances in machining and sculpturing ever shrinking features out of bulk materials such as silicon. With the flourishing multidisciplinary field of low-dimensional nanomaterials, including one-dimensional (1D) nanowires/nanotubes and two-dimensional (2D) atomic layers such as graphene/phosphorene, growing interests and sustained effort have been devoted to creating mechanical devices toward the ultimate limit of miniaturization─genuinely down to the molecular or even atomic scale. These ultrasmall movable structures, particularly nanomechanical resonators that exploit the vibratory motion in these 1D and 2D nano-to-atomic-scale structures, offer exceptional device-level attributes, such as ultralow mass, ultrawide frequency tuning range, broad dynamic range, and ultralow power consumption, thus holding strong promises for both fundamental studies and engineering applications. In this Review, we offer a comprehensive overview and summary of this vibrant field, present the state-of-the-art devices and evaluate their specifications and performance, outline important achievements, and postulate future directions for studying these miniscule yet intriguing molecular-scale machines.},

  abstract     = {Cooling down nanomechanical force probes is a generic strategy to enhance their sensitivities through the concomitant reduction of their thermal noise and mechanical damping rates. However, heat conduction becomes less efficient at low temperatures, which renders difficult to ensure and verify their proper thermalization. Here we implement optomechanical readout techniques operating in the photon counting regime to probe the dynamics of suspended silicon carbide nanowires in a dilution refrigerator. Readout of their vibrations is realized with sub-picowatt optical powers, in a situation where less than one photon is collected per oscillation period. We demonstrate their thermalization down to 32 ± 2 {mK}, reaching very large sensitivities for scanning probe force sensors, 40 {zN} Hz−1/2, with a sensitivity to lateral force field gradients in the {fN} m−1 range. This opens the road toward explorations of the mechanical and thermal conduction properties of nanoresonators at minimal excitation level, and to nanomechanical vectorial imaging of faint forces at dilution temperatures.},

We use the detection of shifts in the resonance frequency of the nanotubes to sense and determine the inertial mass of atoms as well as the mass of the nanotube. This highly sensitive mass detection capability may eventually enable applications such as on-chip detection, analysis, and identiﬁcation of compounds.},

                  Electromechanical resonators are a key element in radio‐frequency telecommunication devices and thus new resonator concepts from nanotechnology can readily find important industrial opportunities. Here, the successful experimental realization of {AM}, {FM}, and digital demodulation with suspended single‐walled carbon‐nanotube resonators in a field‐effect transistor configuration is reported. The crucial role played by the electromechanical resonance in demodulation is clearly demonstrated. The {FM} technique is shown to lead to the suppression of unwanted background signals and the reduction of noise for a better detection of the mechanical motion of nanotubes. The digital data‐transfer rate of standard cell‐phone technology is within the reach of these devices.},
