Poscidyn is primarily targeted to users that want to simulate experimentally realistic time responses and frequency sweeps. This library is not meant to serve as a continuation package on itself. It is build to simplify the process for common oscillator models and excitations types. If Poscidyn does not contain the models or excitations types you are looking for? The [Extending Poscidyn](../usage/extending-poscidyn) page of this documentation explains how you can fit this package to your needs.
